# To Do App:
An application to store to-do items and calendar events.
This is a personal project to get more experience with APIs, as well as sharpen my Java, Git, and GCP skills.

# Plan for Application:
The application will store both to-do list items and calendar events.

To do items:
- able to be completed
- can be dated or undated
- if repeated, choose whether to "double up" or to only repeat if the item is completed

Calendar events:
- no completion status
- dated only

Both:
- repeatable or single-time
- title + optional description
- choose all-day or a certain time period

Application should be able to be synced with Google Calendar.
